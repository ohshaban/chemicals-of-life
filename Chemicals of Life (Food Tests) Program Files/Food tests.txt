- Test for reducing sugars (example: glucose)
- Reagent : Benedict's solution (blue)
- Test : Heat food sample (crushed water extract if sample if solid) with the same volume of benedict's solution in a test tube, over a boiling water bath for three minutes.
- Positive result : Colour change from blue to brick red.
- Conclusion :  Reducing sugars present.
- Negative result : Solution stays blue.
- Conclusion : Reducing sugars absent.
- Precautions : 1. Wear safety goggles, lab coat, and gloves.
				2. The test tube mouth should face away from you.
				3. Use a water bath for heating the solution.
			  
- Test for starch
- Reagent : Iodine solution (yellow/brown)
- Test : To 2 cm3 of the water extract of the crushed food sample, add a few drops of iodine solution. Then shake.
- Positive result : Colour change from yellow/brown to blue/black
- Conclusion :  Starch is present.
- Negative result : Colour stays yellow/brown.
- Conclusion : Starch is absent.

- Test for proteins
- Reagent : Biuret reagent (blue)
- Test : To 2 cm3 of water extract of crushed food sample, add sodium hydroxide (aq), then dropwise add copper sulphate (aq). Shake gently.
- Positive result : Colour change from blue to purple (mauve/lilac/violet)
- Conclusion : Proteins present.
- Negative result : Colour of mixture stays ble.
- Conclusion : Proteins absent.

- Test for lipids
- Reagent : Ethanol (colourless)
- Test : To the crushed food sample (do not prepare a water extract), add ethanol. Shake gently, then filter. Let the filtrate drop into a test tube containing distilled water.
- Positive result : The distilled water becomes milky (from clear).
- Conclusion : Lipids are present.
- Negative result : The distilled water stays clear.
- Conclusion : Lipids are absent.
- The more the milkiness/turbidity, the greater the amount of lipids present.
